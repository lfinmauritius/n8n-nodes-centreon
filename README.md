# n8n-nodes-centreon

## Description

The **n8n-nodes-centreon** package integrates Centreon into your n8n workflows to automate downtime management, collect monitoring data, and much more. With this node, you can schedule, list, or delete maintenance windows directly from n8n, without writing any code to interact with the Centreon API.

## Features

- Authenticate with the Centreon API
- Create downtimes (maintenance windows) for hosts and services
- Create or delete hosts or services
- List existing hosts or services
- Acknowledge hosts or services
- List or apply configuration on pollers
- Full support for API parameters (duration, type, comments, etc.)

## Prerequisites

- **n8n** v0.200.0 or higher
- **Centreon** v22.10 or higher
- A Centreon API user with the required permissions (ACL and rights on Realtime API and configuration API)

## Installation

Install the node via npm in your n8n custom nodes folder:

```bash
npm install n8n-nodes-centreon
```

Then restart your n8n instance.

## Configuration

1. In n8n, navigate to **Credentials**
2. Click **New**, then select **Centreon API**
3. Fill in the fields:
   - **Base URL**: The URL of your Centreon instance (e.g., `https://monitoring.yourdomain.com`)
   - **Username**: API username
   - **Password**: API password
   - **Ignore SSL**: `true` if you’re using a self-signed certificate
4. Save your credentials.

## Usage

1. Create a new workflow in n8n.
2. Add a **Centreon** node and choose the desired operation:
   - **Host** : Acknowledge/Add/Delete/Downtime or List host
   - **Service** :  Acknowledge/Add/Delete/Downtime or List service
   - **Monitoring server** : List or Apply configuration on a poller
3. Select your Centreon credentials and provide the required parameters (host, service, start time, end time, etc.).
4. Connect it into your workflow and execute!

### Example: Automating Downtimes from an ITSM Tool

```plaintext
[Webhook ITSM] → [Parse Payload] → [Centreon: Create Downtime]
```

- The webhook node receives maintenance data from your ITSM tool (e.g., ServiceNow, Jira Service Management).
- The function node parses the payload to extract start, end, and host information.
- The Centreon node schedules the maintenance window automatically.
